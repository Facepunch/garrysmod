{
// First, mount all user customizations. This will search for VPKs and subfolders
// and mount them in alphabetical order. The easiest way to distribute a mod is to
// pack up the custom content into a VPK. To "install" a mod, just drop it in this
// folder.
//
// Note that this folder is scanned only when the game is booted.
game+mod garrysmod/custom/*

// Now search loose files. We'll set the directory containing the gameinfo.txt file
// as the first "mod" search path (after any user customizations). This is also the one
// that's used when writing to the "mod" path.
game+mod+mod_write+default_write_path |gameinfo_path|.
gamebin |gameinfo_path|bin

// We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in
// VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files
// in folders where they don't exist. (Searching a VPK is much faster than making an operating
// system call.)
