garrysmod
=========

This repo consists of the 'light' stuff from the Garry's Mod client install. Namely all of the Lua stuff - without any of the binaries.

This stuff is svn external'd into the main Garry's Mod client repo - at http://svn.facepunchstudios.com/svn/gm/

Pull requests are welcome :)
