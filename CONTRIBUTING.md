=============

Here's what you need to know if you wish to submit Pull Requests to this repository.

=============

* Your code formatting must be consistent with the rest of the code base
* Use tabulation to indent your code - TAB size = 4 spaces
* Do not add unnecessary changes to your code - do not "fix" white space or remove comments

Trouble In Terrorist Town
=============
Any TTT changes in Pull Requests should be separate. Do not combine TTT changes and other base lua changes in the same PR.
